# Confidence

I don't know exactly how (yet) but the idea is to calculate how confident we are in our dataset using different possible criteria...

---

### Criteria

One possible criterium could be, how aligned (or not) the different cuts/PDPlots are with one another:

> If they are kinda aligned: we are confident in the data
> 
> If they are rather chaotic: we are *less* confident
